# Project 2 - Simplified 3D Diffusion Model

Organization of Programming Languages Project 2
C compilation instructions: Enter "gcc diffusion.c -lm" on the command line.
C execution instructions: Using the name of the executable file created by the
gcc compiler, enter "(executable file name) (positive room size integer)" to run
the program with the specified room size and without a partition, or enter
"(executable file name) (positive room size integer) partition" to run the
program with both the specified room size and a partition. The partition's
height will be 75% of the room's height, floored to the nearest integer less
than or equal to the 75% height.
C# compilation instructions: Enter "mcs diffusion.cs" in the command line.
C# execution instructions: Enter "mono diffusion.exe (positive room size
integer)" in the command line to run the program with the specified room size
and without a partition. Enter "mono diffusion.exe (positive room size integer)
partition" in the command line to run the program with both the specified room
size and a partition. The partition's height will be 75% of the room's height,
floored to the nearest integer less than or equal to the 75% height.
