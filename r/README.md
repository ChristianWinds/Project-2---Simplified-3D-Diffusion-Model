R compilation instructions: diffusion.r does not require a compilation command.
R execution instructions: Before running diffusion.r, change the maxSize
variable in the diffusion.r source code to change the number of room divisions
to be used in the diffusion.r execution. If diffusion.r is not yet executable,
enter "chmod u+x diffusion.r" on the command line. When diffusion.r is
executable, enter "./diffusion.r" to run diffusion.r. The diffusion.r program
will not correctly complete a diffusion simulation, however, as the diffusion.r
algorithm is incomplete.
