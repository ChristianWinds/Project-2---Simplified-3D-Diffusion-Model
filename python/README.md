Python compilation instructions: No compilation command is used for
diffusion.py.
Python execution instructions: Before executing diffusion.py, change the maxSize
integer in the diffusion.py source code to set the number of room divisions used
for a diffusion.py run, and set the diffusion.py source code's partitionFlag
variable to False to run diffusion.py without a partition, or set the
partitionFlag variable to True to run diffusion.py with a partition. The
partition's height will be 75% of the room's vertical divisions' total height,
floored to the nearest room division integer less than or equal to the 75%
height. Enter "python diffusion.py" in the command line to run diffusion.py.
