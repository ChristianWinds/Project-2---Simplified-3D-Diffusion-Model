Fortran compilation instructions: With both checkIfCellInPartitionModule.f90 and
diffusion.f90 in the same directory, enter the command "gfortran
checkIfCellInPartitionModule.f90 diffusion.f90" to compile the source code
necessary to run the diffusion.f90 program.
Fortran execution instructions: In the diffusion.f90 source code, change the maxSize integer to With the files checkifcellinpartitionmodule.mod
and a.out, each created from compilng checkIfCellInPartitionModule.f90 and
diffusion.f90, in the current directory, enter a.out in the command line to run
the diffusion.f90 program.
