Julia compilation instructions: No compilation command is used.
Julia execution instructions: If diffusion.jl is not already executable, enter
"chmod u+x diffusion.jl" on the command line. To change the mSize for a
diffusion.jl run, change the maxSize integer value in the diffusion.jl source
code. Set partitionFlag to false in the diffusion.jl source code to prepare
diffusion.jl to run without a partition, or set partitionFlag to true to prepare
diffusion.jl to run with an active partition. When diffusion.jl is executable,
enter "./diffusion.jl" to run diffusion.jl.
