Lisp compilation instructions: diffusion.lisp does not use a compilation
command.
Lisp execution instructions: If diffusion.lisp is not already executable, enter
"chmod u+x diffusion.lisp" on the command line. When diffusion.lisp is
executable, enter "./diffusion.lisp" to run diffusion.lisp. diffusion.lisp does
not perform a diffusion simulation; the program also cannot activate or
deactivate a partition for a diffusion simulation.
