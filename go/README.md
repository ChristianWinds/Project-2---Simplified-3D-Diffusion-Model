Go compilation instructions: diffusion.go does not require an explicit
compilation command.
Go execution instructions: Enter "go run diffusion.go" upon the command line to
run the program without a partition, or enter "go run diffusion.go (argument)
partition" to run the program with an active partition. The argument entered as
"argument" does not affect the maximum room size; the maximum room size is
instead changed by editing the value of "maxSize" within the diffusion.go source
code.
